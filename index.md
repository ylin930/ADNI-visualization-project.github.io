# Alzheimer's Disease Visualization Project

Overview:

Goals: 

Plan:
  Tentative plan: Make a web-based visualization and interative tool of ADNI data 
  
## People

We are a group of graduate students at the University of Rochester who are part of the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship in Data-Enabled Research into Human Behavior and its Cognitive and Neural Mechanisms. More information about this traineeship can be found at http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/graduate/nrt.html.

Bios:

Ying Lin is first-year PhD student in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department. Her research interests include visual and auditory perception in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, and cognitive decline in the aging population. She received her bachelor’s degree in behavioral neuroscience and Japanese from Colgate University in 2015.

Greta Smith is a first-year data science MS candidate. Her research interests include data-driven advancement of healthcare and disease management. She received her bachelor’s degree in neuroscience from the University of Rochester in 2015.

Max Wasserman is a first-year computer science PhD candidate.

## Data:
We plan to use data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimagine Initiative. More information about this project can be found at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/.

## Updates
1. Emailed ADNI PIs to ask/discuss potential project
2. Interviewed PIs/Postdocs about developing a helpful tool
3. Submited application to access ADNI data
4. Waiting for experts to reply back 

## Next Steps
1. Tutorial of R shiny and start a rough daft of the interactive website 
2. Edit and update current website (include tabs)
3. Brainstorm plan B: Using ECG data to improve sliding window technique to distinguish actual signal from artifacts
